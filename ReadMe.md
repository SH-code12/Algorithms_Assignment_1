# Assignment #1 For Algorithms
### Task 1: Fibonacci Series

- Implement the Fibonacci series using recursion. 
- Implement the Fibonacci series using divide and conquer (matrix multiplication) . 
- Implement the Fibonacci series using dynamic programming

### Task 2: Search Algorithms

- Sequential Search:
- Recursive Sequential Search
- Binary Search
- Recursive Binary Search

### Task 3: Heap, Priority Queue and Heap Sort

1. Implement a Heap: 
   - Define a class/structure for the heap.
   - Implement methods for inserting an element and maintaining the heap property
   (heapify).
   - Implement methods to extract the maximum and minimum from the heap.
2. Implement a Priority Queue: 
   - Use the heap implementation (from step 1) to build a priority queue.
   - Define methods for inserting an element with a priority and extracting the highest
   priority element.
   - Ensure the insertion maintains the heap property.
3. Implement Heap Sort: 
   - Utilize your heap implementation to sort an array.
   - Build a max heap from the array and repeatedly extract the max element from the
   heap and rebuild it until the array is sorted
